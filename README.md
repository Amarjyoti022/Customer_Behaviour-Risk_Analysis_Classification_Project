# Customer_Behaviour-Risk_Analysis_Classification_Project
End-to-end customer classification project for churn risk & fraud detection using advanced data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, and multiple ML models including Logistic Regression, KNN, SVC, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost

## Project Overview for GitHub
This project is an end-to-end machine learning classification system designed to predict customer churn risk and fraudulent activity using a real-world customer analytics dataset.
The workflow covers complete ML lifecycle — from data collection and preprocessing to model comparison and performance evaluation.

## Key Highlights
Dataset Understanding: Customer demographics, transaction history, spending patterns, and risk labels (Churn & Fraud).

Data Preprocessing: Missing value treatment, duplicate removal, outlier handling, and date-time conversion.

Feature Engineering

EDA: Distribution analysis, churn/fraud patterns, category preferences, correlation heatmaps.

Modeling: Implemented 8 classification algorithms — Logistic Regression, KNN, SVC, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.

Evaluation: Compared models on Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC to find the best-performing model.

Business Impact: Enables proactive churn prevention, fraud detection, and customer segmentation for targeted marketing campaigns.
